```

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { openPdf } from 'pdf-simple';
import fs from 'node:fs/promises';

// Open a PDF file
const pdf = await openPdf('/path/to/document.pdf');

// Render all pages
for await (const page of pdf.renderPages()) {
  await fs.writeFile(`page-${page.pageNumber}.jpg`, page.buffer);
}

// Don't forget to close
await pdf.close();
```
